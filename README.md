## 🧠 What is a Keylogger?

A **keylogger** (short for keystroke logger) is a type of surveillance tool used to record keystrokes made on a keyboard. It's commonly used in:

- **Ethical hacking** for red-team/blue-team exercises
- **Security audits** to test endpoint protections
- **Parental or self-monitoring** (with consent)

**⚠️ Illegal use of keyloggers is a serious offense** and a violation of privacy laws. This tool is strictly for **educational and ethical testing purposes**.
